# ðŸ¦™ðŸ“š Columbia Copilot

Columbia Copilot is an AI-powered chatbot designed to answer questions about Columbia University. It leverages the capabilities of OpenAI's GPT-4 and LlamaIndex to provide accurate and contextually relevant responses based on the data it has been trained on.

## Overview of the App

- Takes user queries via Streamlit's `st.chat_input` and displays both user queries and model responses with `st.chat_message`.
- Uses LlamaIndex to load and index data and create a chat engine that will retrieve context from that data to respond to each user query.
